### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal of the application is for users to view and learn facts about different animals. The information on the animals include the name of the animal, latin name, animal type (Amphibian, Bird, Mammal, or Reptile), the time the animal is active (Diurnal or Nocturnal), the maximum length of the animal in feet, and the maximum weight in pounds, the lifepan in years, the animal's habitat, diet, and geographical location.

The user can also sort by the name of the animal with radio buttons from Ascending (A-Z), Descending (Z-A), or none at all. The user can also filter by the animal's active time and animal_type with radio buttons simultaneously.

The user is able to add and remove an animal to their favorites and the total/aggregate maximum length of the animals in the favorites list updates accordingly. The user is also able to clear their favorites list with the "Clear Favorites" button.

The value to the user is the ability to explore and learn about cool animals and facts about the animals while keeping track of their favorites with efficiency.
