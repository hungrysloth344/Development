### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal of the application is for users to view different animals and add or remove them from their favorites. The user can also sort by the name of the animal from A-Z, Z-A, or none at all. There is also functionality to filter by the animal's active time (Diurnal or Nocturnal) and animal_type (ambhibian, bird, mammal, or reptile). Lastly, it also aggregates the total maximum length of the animal. The value to the user is the ability to explore and learn about cool animals and their facts and favorite them with efficiency.

### Usability Principles Considered
